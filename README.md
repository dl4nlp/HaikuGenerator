HaikuGenerator
==============

Generates random Haiku with some help from NLTK and the Brown and Gutenberg corpuses.

Run haikuGen.py with brownBigramDict.txt, gutenbergBigramDict.txt, and syllableDict.txt in the same directory. 
These text files store Python dictionaries in text form which, using the Pickle module, are returned to their native forms at runtime.
